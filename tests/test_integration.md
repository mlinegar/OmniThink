A single end-to-end run should yield (i) a normal OmniThink article with inline citations; (ii) a knowledge graph file; (iii) labels for each canonical node under the chosen schema; and (iv) audit reports. Acceptability is judged by the following facts: first, the ledger parses to MCR < 0.25 on the final draft; second, edge-compatibility shows zero invalid triples against `compat_schema.yaml`; third, route-consistency reports no KL divergences above the configured threshold for nodes that are route-equivalent under the canonicalization; fourth, the labeler emits a non-degenerate distribution for at least eighty percent of canonicals and returns a minimal justification trace with valid evidence pointers in each case. These criteria are purely post‑hoc, as requested, and do not slow the core pipeline (§3.3’s writer remains unmodified).  [oai_citation:25‡OmniThink.pdf](file-service://file-5ZNd7ZBEcYkbc9RdjrkKwE)
